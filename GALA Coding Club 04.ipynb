A **list comprehension** allows you to generate this same list in just one line of code. A list comprehension combines the for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically appends each new element. List comprehensions are not always presented to beginners, but I have included them here because you’ll most likely see them as soon as you start looking at other people’s code."
