    "### Polygon \n",
    "A collection of Latitude and Longitude pairs, where the last pair is the same as the first pair, is a **Polygon**.  We did this with a line surrounding the zip code 90036. \n",

    "When you download a shape file from a website, or government data source, it usually comes with three or more files in a zipped folder.  In the case of the data there were 6 files.  Let's take a look inside 'cb_2017_us_zcta510_500k’ in our data folder , which I downloaded from the US census.\n",
