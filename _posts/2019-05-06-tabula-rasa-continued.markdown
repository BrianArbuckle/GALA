For today's hands on review, we are going to continue with tabula rasa, a blank slate.  The girls will write a function that performs a calculation on a list of numbers, that we will then test with various lists they create. 

Here is today's challenge:

1. Celsius °C to Fahrenheit °F converter:
    ### $\frac{9}{5}$ $\times$	$c$ $+$ $32$<br>
2. Find the area of a circle with the radius:
    ### $a = \pi \times r^2$<br>
