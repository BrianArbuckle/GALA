The DataFrame we created last week will allow us to get down to the business of plotting our Choropleth map.  

We will revisit the number of students per zip code in a box plot, and reveal the benefits of interquartile multiples, as a whisker range, verses a traditional min/max range.  We will adjust the color ranges to accommodate the outliers, and help create a beautiful Choropleth map in Folium.
