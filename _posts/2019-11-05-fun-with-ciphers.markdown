Last week, I shared with the group a fun side project I have been playing with, ciphers.  It presented an oppoutunty to go over local and global scopes, which is my excuse for taking this fun diverson in the world of ciphers and code breaking.  

This week I am sharing the code that I demonstrated last week.  I will be introducing Unicode and the way to operate with it mathematically.
