We spent ten sessions making a choropleth map, yet today we are going to learn how to use a different kind of map, the map function. 

Last session's challenge was writing the following functions:

1. Celsius °C to Fahrenheit °F converter:<br>
2. Find the area of a circle with the radius:<br>

Today we will learn how to apply them with the map function, instead of writing a loop.
