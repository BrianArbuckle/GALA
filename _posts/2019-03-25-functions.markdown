In the coming weeks, we are going to do some hands on review of everything we have learned.  But before we do that, we need to learn one more python feature: **Functions**.

Functions will give use the ability to code our code reviews in small, testable, lines of code. It will also give the students a glimpse of the power of computer programming.  Instead of repeating tasks, or typing the same line of code over and over again, we just can write it once, in a function.
