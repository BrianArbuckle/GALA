Dealing with last session's data, I relized we need to update our workflow and dig deeper into files and paths. We will take a look into the *os* and *urllib* modules.  

Due to the limitations of coding on Chrome Books, we have switched to Google Colaboratory, which is a nice notebook interface, that works with google docs. Due to the server-based nature of the Google Colaboratory environment,  files, paths, downloads and importing are not as straight forward as they are when dealing with local files and data.
