The girls took a survey regarding future studies and here are the results to the question, "In addition to Intermediate Python, please rank what you would like to study in the fall‚Äù.
(The top three were nearly a tie):

1  IOT - Internet of Things
2. Coding Only Math 
3. More Data Science  
4. Web
5. Video Games 
6. GUI 

The good news is we can touch on all the topics as we focus on the top three. For instance, building a weather sensor as an IOT project, could require coding a GUI, and web interface that will give us data to analyze, with additional Data Science tools.  Also, we can touch on gamification and game theory with the algorithms in Coding Only Math - you will be surprised how related these can be.

Today we will dive into Coding Only Math, with some Project Eular questions while exploring more aspects of functional programming.
