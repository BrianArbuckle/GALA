        <p>This repository is for the 2018-2019 middle school python coding
          club that I run at the <strong>Girls Academic Leadership Academy,
          Dr. Michelle King School for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (GALA)</strong>.
          The club meets once a week during the girlsâ€™ lunch break.

        <h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
        <p>The goal of the club is to engage the girls in coding,
           beyond scratch, with hands-on practical data science and IOT projects to see 
           the problem-solving potential of coding in everyday life.
