    "### When Naming and Using Variables you need to follow a few rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "> • Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.<br>\n",
    "> • Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, **`greeting_message`** works, but **`greeting message`** will cause errors.<br>\n",
    "> • Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word **`print.`** <br>\n",
    "> • Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.<br>\n",
    "> • Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.<br>\n",
    "> `The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but it’s a good idea to avoid using them for now, you will see why when you learn about \"Classes\"`\n",

    "So far we have been working with one data type, which is a **`string`**.  Let's dive into string a bit more, before we go into other data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this:\n",
    "> `\"This is a string.\"`<br>\n",
    "> `'This is also a string.'`\n",

    "In this example, the lowercase string \"julie dorris\" is stored in the variable name. The method `title()` appears after the variable in the `print()` statement. **A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data.** The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work (remember how the print *function* worked). That information is provided inside the parentheses. The `title()` function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.\n",
    "`title()` displays each word in titlecase, where each word begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your program to recognize the input values Julie, JULIE, and julie as the same name, and display all of them as Julie."
